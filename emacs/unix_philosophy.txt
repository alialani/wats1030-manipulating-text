The Unix Philosophy
From The UNIX Programming Environmnet (1984) by Brian Kerighan and Rob Pike

Even thought the UNIX system introduces a number of innovative prorams and techniques, no single prgram or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes it effective is the approach to programming, a philosophy of using the computer. Although that philosophy can't be written down is a sigle sentence, at its heart is the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves. many UNIX programs do quite trivial things in isolation, but, combined with other programs, become general and useful tools.
